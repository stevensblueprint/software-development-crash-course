# Software Development Crash Course

The goal of this workshop is to help you improve how you develop Software both independently, but especially as a TEAM. We are using a very simple Flask/Python web app to illustrate the concepts we will be discussing. The focus is not on writing the code itself, but on the process of developing the code.
